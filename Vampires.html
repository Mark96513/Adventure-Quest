    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="story">
        Once the sun goes down, the Vampires Clans rises from the dark. Charging through the shadowy forests looking for
        someone to tear.
        <br>
        <br>
        On their wings, they very swift creatures with sharp talons and fangs. This creature is to be feared the most.
        <br>
        <br>
        They are also intelligent and cunning, however they are easily burnt out.
        <br>
        <br>
        Blood thirsty creature that fears nothing-except the sun.
        <em>"ARRRR!!!!"</em> As it wakes!
