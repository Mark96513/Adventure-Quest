    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="story">
        Demons are the destroyers of civilisations. They are evil spirits, if they are able to possess a human being,
        they will turn into nightmarish creatures.
        <br>
        <br>
        Living burning hell, from the ashes rises a powerful demon. They are huge and powerful. They can cause
        earthquakes if so willing.
        <br>
        <br>
        They have high armor which makes them durable in combat.
        <br>
        <br>
        Their only goal is destruction in the earth.
        <em>"ROARRRRRRRR!!!!"</em> It said!

    <h2>Weakness</h2>

    <div class="story">

        <p>
            They are powerful but very slow, also they don't have much compassion, lacking in mental capacity to assess
            situations, they just love to create chaos.
            <br>
            Any cold matter is their weakness, not water!
            Natural enemies includes:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Everyone </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            To become one of them is the sacrifice you have to make, to be powerful enough to defeat the Witch and its
            dominions,
            and ultimately save the wondrous angel princess!
