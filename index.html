    <h2>Story</h2>

    <p class="story">
        Long time ago there was a beautiful princess called Aurora. She lived happily and freely. She was the most
        beautiful angel princess to have ever lived and was adored by everyone she meets.
        <br>
        <br>
        One night, when she was fast asleep in the Castle, a witch appeared before her. The witch saw how beautiful she
        was, he wanted to keep her forever.
        <br>
        <br>
        The witch spinned his cane 3 times and whispered some dark magic spells. A vortex then appeared, where it captured the
        angel princess, the witch besides her.
        <br>
        <br>
        The angel princess let out a loud scream <em>"Helpppppp Meeeeeeeee!"</em> to which woke everyone in the city!
        Her cry for help was heard before she disappeared with the witch.
        Can you help save and find the beautiful angel princess?

        <p>
            Upon the relevelation of the princess missing, the officials made a cry of plea for someone to help. And
            then..
        </p>

        <p>
            4 supernatural beings set foot in the city. They offered to convert anyone who wishes to become them.
        </p>

    <div class="story">

        <p>
            They were:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mark the Angel, </li>
            <li>Allen the Demon, </li>
            <li>Josh the Werewolf </li>
            <li>and Michael the Vampire. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To become one of them was the sacrifice you have to make, to be powerful enough to defeat the Witch and its
            dominions,
            and ultimately save the wondrous angel princess.
